    <p>Welcome, guys!</p>
    <p>My name is Dima. I&#39;m the host of a series of videos that will be appearing on this site. These videos will have an applied character - that means you will study how to utilize english in various fields of study such as Marketing, Finances, Information Technologies, Electricity, Sports, Job Interviews, American Culture, Travelling, Daily life and many others. Thus, I promise to expose you to a specific vocabulary, jargon or slang that people use at work, the gym or on the street. So, if you want to speak with a professional vocab and find out something new while listening to english - this site is for you. The script of all the videos that I will be making will be checked by several native speakers, primarily from the north and central states of the USA. So as you watch these videos you will pick up some American English.</p>
    <p>All these videos will be available on my YouTube channel as well. Subscribe to it. If you do so, you will receive notifications about my new videos.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or doubts concerning the topics I teach, please leave your comments below the video and I&#39;ll try to make it better next time.</p>
    <p>Thanks for Watching!</p>

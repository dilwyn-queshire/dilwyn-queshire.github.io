				<h2>Lewis Carroll</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (27 January 1832 â€“ 14 January 1898), better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll, was an English writer, mathematician, logician, Anglican deacon and photographer. </p>
			<p>His most famous writings are Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland, its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, which includes the poem Jabberwocky, and the poem The Hunting of the Snark, all examples of the genre of literary nonsense. </p>
			<p>He is noted for his facility at word play, logic, and fantasy. There are societies in many parts of the world (including the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, and New Zealand[3]) dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works and the investigation of his life. In 1982, his great-nephew unveiled his memorial stone in Poets&#39; Corner, Westminster Abbey.</p>
